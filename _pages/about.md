I am a senior lecturer in quantum computing and quantum information at the University of Melbourne in the [School of Physics](https://physics.unimelb.edu.au/) and [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/).

I am fascinated by open questions, and so am drawn in by quantum computing, which combines my love of physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering, and throws up a constant stream of new challenges. My primary research interests have been quantum control, semi-conductor based quantum computing, tensor network techniques, quantum algorithms and quantum error correction.

I teach the masters courses [Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2021/subjects/mult90063), and jointly [Quantum Software Fundamentals](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90084), as well as the second year course [Elements of Quantum Computing](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2021/subjects/mult20015).
