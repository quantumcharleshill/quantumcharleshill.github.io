I am a senior lecturer in quantum computing and quantum information at the University of Melbourne in the [School of Physics](https://physics.unimelb.edu.au/) and [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/).

I am fascinated by open questions, and so am drawn in by quantum computing, which combines my love of physics, mathematics, and computer science, and throws up a constant stream of new challenges. With twenty years experience in the field, my primary research interests have been quantum control, semiconductor-based quantum computing, tensor network techniques, quantum algorithms, non-Markovian tomography, and quantum error correction. Most recently, I helped establish the [IBM Quantum Hub](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/quantumhub) at the University of Melbourne.

I teach the masters courses [Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2021/subjects/mult90063), and jointly [Quantum Software Fundamentals](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90084), as well as the second-year course [Elements of Quantum Computing](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2021/subjects/mult20015).

Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess, bicycle-touring, orienteering, and travel.
